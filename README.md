Human Computer Interaction
High Fidelity Prototype for Rate my coop app.
Designed a smartphone application for college students, particularly for Northeastern University students, to rate and review their cooperative education (coop) experiences. 
The goal is to provide an interactive platform where students can provide feedback about different organizations, roles, and their overall experience during their coop jobs. 
This feedback will then be available to other students who are considering or preparing for their coop opportunities.
